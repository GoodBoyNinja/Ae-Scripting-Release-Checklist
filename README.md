# JSX Scripts Release Checklist
---
> Developers, please feel free to contribute to this list based on your own experience





* 🐑 Convert your file to JSXBIN to (partially) protect your code and reduce chance of privacy.
* 🐑 Make sure any references to After-Effects properties are done by **Matchnames**, to avoid issues in non-english versions of After-Effects.
