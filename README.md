🔒 Protect your work
* 🐑 [Convert your file to JSXBIN](https://extendscript.docsforadobe.dev/vscode-debugger/vscode-extension-features.html#exporting-as-binary) to (partially) protect your code and reduce chance of privacy.

🌎 Make sure your script work across the globe
* 🐑 Use [Match Names](/resources/matchNames.md) instead of Names when referencing items in After-Effects.
* 🐑 If your script creates, appends or modifies expressions, make sure those expressions also use [Match Names](/resources/matchNames.md) instead of Names.
